Homework 1 - q3_32_README.txt

The data and distance matrices are created using the code provided by the textbook, modified to work in Python.

To solve the problem, we simply applied our own SVD function on the distance matrix, requesting 3 singular values (since the rank of the distance matrix is at most 3).
Then we observed the singular values returned by our SVD method.
