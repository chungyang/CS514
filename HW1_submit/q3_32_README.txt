The distance matrix is a (3 x 10) matrix.
After performing SVD on the distance matrix, we find that the 3 singular values are 
[0.330032787 0.0217985474 3.86625081e-05]

Note that the 3rd singular value is significantly smaller than the first 2 singular values.
Hence we can approximate the distance matrix by a rank 2 matrix, which is (2 x 10).
Hence the data lies on a lower dimensional "sheath".
