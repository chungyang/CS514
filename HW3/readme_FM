Flajolet-Martin algorithm is implemented as follow

1, Upon being initialized, it calculates a prime number between (9999, 2*9999)

2, pick two randoms numbers a and b from (1, p-1)

3, For every incoming data d, calculate (a * d + b) % p

4, calculate min hash value

5, approximate the number of distinct values by (10000 / min hash) when function approximate() is called, for min hash = 0, return 10000
